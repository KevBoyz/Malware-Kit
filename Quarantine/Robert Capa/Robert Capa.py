# Robert Capa going to be as close as he can to your target to take a photo

# Spy a desktop screen in your local net taking screen prints and sending to a server in your local machine
# If you wish, you can host the server on the Internet using hosting services such as Hostigator
# To execute this you need to start the server on your local machine, get the host ip and put then as the
# value of the host var on Robert Capa.py, doing this, put this file on your target machine and execute it.
# If everything works, you will get 4  from Robert named as 1,2,3 respectively
