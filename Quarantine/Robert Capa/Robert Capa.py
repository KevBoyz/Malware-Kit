# Occasionally he's going to step on a mine and explode not before of course recording everything.
# Spy a desktop screen in your local net taking screen prints and sending to a server in your local machine
# If you wish, you can host the server on the Internet using hosting services such as Hostigator
# To execute this you need to start the server on your local machine, get the host ip and put then as the
# value of the host var on Robert Capa.py, doing this, put the file on your target machine and execute it.
# If everything works, you will get a screen print every 3 seconds from Robert named as 1,2,3 respectively
